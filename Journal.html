<p><b>(1)</b> The point of a strategy is to prompt you to take action in

it. Which is it?</p>
<p><b>(2)</b> Your strategy has been time-tested for decades by proven

<p>9 down days in a row on the IWO, wow! Things feel and look worse than
I had expected on this pullback. Is this just forming the left side of a
scary looking shakeout?</p>

<p>Decent action from Focus List today. Several names put in solid days
and firmed up. CRVL, NFLX, PERI, MGNI, ONON, SGH, ESE. Not entertaining
anything right now. Just watching. Feels like mid-week we could see some
pivot failures in these names but well see.</p>
<p>Underneath the surface things continued to deteriorate today. Perhaps
this will be more than just a light pullback. Light volume on indexes.
Most were green today but on light volume. New highs/new lows registered
more new lows on the nasdaq today. Breadth readings showing declining %
above ma’s. Wait and see mode. Feeling the pulse of the market..</p>

<p><b> Right now the market is telling me to be cautious. I recently got
stopped out of positions, TML’s are getting loose and/or looking
vulnerable, indexes are under distribution, New highs/new lows is
deteriorating along with most breadth readings. From a contrarian
perspective, sentiment is getting slightly bearish but nothing major to
make me take a contrarian stance. Ideally, we’d see sentiment continue
to deteriorate, while stocks hold up underneath the surface and the
indexes pullback on lighter volume and get support at key areas. Watch
that Russell 2000. Even more importantly that stocks are setting up and
buyable. Are there lots of names on Focus list? </b></p>
<p>It’s been a weird week. I think I understand what depression is and
what it feels like. First time that happened was when I moved to SLC and
then again while here. Much easier this time around being with Adriana.
Learning that I have mental / emotional weaknesses that I need to work
on. I recently, within the past two days or so, made some mental shifts
or adjustments that have helped me navigate the move: be patient and
treat yourself with grace. Moving is tough. Starting a business is
tough. The stock market is tough. Be patient with yourself and make
necessary adjustments. Everything is new and I needed to make some
mental adjustments to help me cope with no current income and a home
that doesn’t feel like home. On to the market..</p>
<p>TML’s look tired. Some earnings blowups: HUBS &amp; RMBS. Most of the
names recently starting to see reversals and volatility. SMCI is the
standout exception. Many names look vulnerable to more downside: MNDY,
GLBE, UBER, ORCL. SOFI lost entire earnings move. Will be interesting to
see if we get support in these names around the 50dma, like: NVDA, UBER.
Strongest looking TML’s: SMCI, PLTR, NVDA, ELF, with plenty more having
just blasted off and extended, like: NIO, UPST. Taking a look at the
weekly’s of these names, they reiterate recent volatility, however, some
names like NVDA, GLBE, UPST, MRVL look fine on weekly chart. Just might
need time..</p>
<p>QQQ, SPY, DJI all saw distribution last week. Several weeks
distribution on QQQ. Look for support at 370 level, 50dma, or at 355
level. Russell 2000 growth saw distribution Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday. IWM pulling in on light volume. Will be interesting to see if
Russell can hold up as this could indicate relative outperformance in
the near-term.. Looking for this.. Nearly every breadth reading shows
momentum leaving the market over the intermediate-term: ST and LT %
above ma’s generally declining, new highs new lows deteriorating.
Sentiment moving slightly bearish. Look to see if new low’s begin to
outpace new highs.. Either way, I would expect the pullback to show less
new lows and for a shorter amount of time than the previous pullback
from March-June. Right now I’m viewing this as a pullback within a
greater uptrend. Pullbacks are buyable. Looking to enter the Russell on
a pullback. Let’s see if a pivot will develop. VIX also spiked up.</p>
<p>Another hole in my system has to do with DeepVue. I realize I have no
clue how group moves have been manifesting. It’s been tough to notice
group info with my DeepVue setup. I’ve made some changes (more needed)
to my setup to help show group info. It includes showing the Industry
Group Rank next to the name in the screener and viewing my screens
ranked by Industry group first and RS second. So far this is helping.
Noticing homebuilders, industrial services, technology services,
Finance, steel, oil and gas, non energy minerals, have many names that
have made big advances.</p>

<p>Added to MRVL today and started a position (1/4) in MNDY today.
Looking at new RS10 screen past two days and plenty of stocks doing well
and continuing their advances. Being super selective but taking setups
as I see them. Will not play into the volatility. Keeping things tight
on these recent buys until they work.</p>
<p>Stalking NVDA to see if it breaks out or breaks down. Staying tight
and looks like it wants higher. Is this a good way to gauge the market?
Will MRVL behave similarly and likely be influenced by NVDA? I think
yes. Come back to this… NVDA, SNPS, MRVL, AVGO, etc. look similar. What
% of a stocks move is the result of the group move?</p>
<p>Note: add more info in a nested table in the Open positions table so
that you can see entries- price, quantity, date.</p>

<p><u>JOURNAL</u></p>
<p>Lots of names with earnings coming up. Risk elevated. Not seeing many
names setup. Not the time to get aggressive with new buys. General
market saw minor distribution last two weeks.</p>
<p>Looking at some of the clearly defined leaders like: SMCI, NVDA,
UBER, PLTR, GLBE, HUBS. They ALL pulled back and had bad days on 7/14
and 7/19. Just like my portfolio.. Considering what happened to my
portfolio on 7/14, it would be wise to be cautious when you see the
leaders begin to falter.. 7/19 as well as following days I saw my
profits vanish and stops starting to get hit. Watch the leaders, if they
get clobbered, watch out! On the flip side, the leaders have all
recovered and look very solid to continue higher. This indicates more
upside to the market. Continue to monitor and look for setups. Be very
selective and cautious but it’s certainly ok to entertain new buys.</p>
<p>Started an ‘RS 10’ scan. Monitor the top 10% RS names in the market
and scan daily. Only scan needed to run daily. Constant 364 names. Will
be much easier to gauge the pulse of the market with a constant # of
names to look at.</p>
<p><u>LEARNING LESSONS:</u></p>
<p>Lots has happened since the last entry. Had written some entries in
real-time in the latter half of July but lost them all due to Windows 10
malfunction. Not a big deal. Re-writing some stuff below.</p>
<p>I learned some very important lessons during this past rally- looking
at my results you see green. More wins than I’ve had in some time. I had
5 winning trades clustered together; yet, when looking at my NAV you see
I made virtually no progress now with the market pulling back. This
highlights some very important mistakes: I was progressively buying and
increasing exposure right into the market pullback. Classic. I believe
this is a clear sign that I’m still in the ‘mechanical stage’ where I’m
simply executing when prompted without much intuition/experience to
override the mechanics. One essential intuitive feel I need to develop
is understanding when momentum is beginning to stall and the market / my
portfolio is likely to pullback. Ideas on “how” to develop this feel
below. In my experience, when the market pullback, so will your account.
To take Mark’s advice of ‘ignoring the market’ totally literally would
be a mistake. Simply, ignore the indexes during the trading day and
don’t look at them until the market is closed. I definitely took this
too literally in the past and didn’t consider the market pulling back in
my execution. It absolutely should be considered and if you have reason
to believe the market will pullback, you have to ask yourself, “am I
willing to let X stock stop me out or would I rather guarantee profits?”
Because usually half will stop you out on the pullback, so it’s very
much a reality and should be baked into the cake. It happens ~50% of the
time. FACT. What’s the plan? This is also important because it should
influence you to stop buying or reduce the exposure of “late” buys. If
you start to see squats, reversals, pressure on portfolio, market is
extended, leaders are extended, would this warrant exercising caution?
Using a single RS screen will help make this so much clearer as long as
it’s analyzed every day. Alternatively, if you’re coming off of a market
correction, leaders are setting back up/ basing, stock ideas setting up
and buyable, would this be THE RIGHT time to start heavy (provided that
things had been working previously)? YES. These are the ‘outside’
factors that need to be considered!</p>
<p>One way to gauge this momentum and stay in-tune with MY market of
stocks- use RS6 or some other RS scan as your main ‘pulse’ of the
market. I like this because it always shows you the same # of stocks.
Top 6% RS is around 200 stocks on DeepVue. Want to see more, check top
10 RS, for example. This way I can quickly get a pulse of the best
stocks in the market and quickly check them each day to note the
changes. Many looking extended? Breaking down? WHAT ARE THE BEST STOCKS
DOING? With the 5-month uptrend as my main screen, it was too difficult
as the # always changed and quickly became 600+ names. Too many and too
much delta. Mark Ritchie uses this as his main screen too and I’m
learning why..</p>
<p>Another issue that happened as a result of this ‘transition’ from
bear to bull (or when experiencing stocks working on avg that are in my
universe) is that I went from pilot positions (~$20 risk) to increasing
my account size to nearly 20k and going in 10-12.5%. Risking 100 or
more. I got to that size just before the market started pulling back.
Two things to note about this: you can’t just wake up and buy everyday
and you shouldn’t.. “It was never the buying that made the big money, it
was the sitting.” Sound familiar? The second thing is that now that I’ve
seen a successful rally and stocks working, I will go in heav(ish)
(~12.5%) right off the bat and look to scale to 25%. This needs to be
done when momentum is just coming back into the market, not way later
after several stocks have worked and I’m up on several names. That’s the
time to slow the buying. Honestly, I think this will take care of MANY
problems b/c when I actually have that much exposure on I won’t be
looking to add names (“b/c now stocks have proven themselves and now I
need to find a name to get heavy in”). I will already be heavy and it
will be in the first to work (or not work). Additionally, by having this
much size on, it will allow me to scale out more incrementally, and
actually hold a piece for a larger move. Previously, I had so little
that it felt pointless to continue to hold. This will by default force
me to hold less names for longer and be in the better names heavier that
breakout early in the rally.</p>

<p>Bought BLMN today. Up immediately. All positions green mid-day with
strong action coming from mid- and small-cap stocks.</p>
<p>QQQ’s continuing their pause while stocks on focus list are breaking
out and holding up. IWM and IWM up over 1% midday, meanwhile, the QQQ’s
are red. Many big tech names like UBER, GOOGL, also pausing. Seems like
this could be exactly as Mark described where we initially had the
big-tech, more mature companies get bids off the market lows and it’s
not until later that institutions move out on the risk curve. Appears we
could be right there. Some unknown names definitely getting bids and
feels like its spreading out. If I can get traction with current list of
names, I will be bringing portfolio money back.</p>
<p>Weird canary in the coal mine is the yields. 1-yr and 2-yr just put

<p>Bought CMG yesterday and SMCI, TMDX today. Stopped on AXSM today
after it gapped down huge. Glad I took profits on the way up! Last two
times I’ve decided to ‘hold for bigger moves’ they have come all the way
back from +15% gains to stop me out. Something to consider for next
time. Will likely just take profits. I’m buying more this week as stocks
on focus list are working and market internals have been improving
nearly all week. I can’t tell if I’m jockeying for positions or
overtrading at this point. Either way I accept the relatively small risk
but it’s tough. Buying solid setups. TMDX was perfect VCP and SMCI was
bottomfishing a power pivot. I saw it working and went for it. 1 share.
Time to gauge market feedback. WILL BE SURE TO SELL ON THE WAY UP.</p>

<p>Stopped on PCVX today. Quite a few names broke hard to the
downside.</p>
<p>BE SUPER SELECTIVE. FINANCE RISK WHEN AVAILABLE. COME IN WITH A
PLAN.</p>
<p>Going through my June trades, there are 3 names that account for $73
of losses that I should have never bought: MBLY, ASML, MRVL. It’s not
that they were terrible setups (MBLY was), but they’re so-so. Why buy
anything but ideal setups in a shitty market? I need to be more
selective and get less excited when things are working for a couple of
days. Be more patient. Things take time to play out in the market.</p>
<p>I need to go into each day with a COMPLETE PLAN. That plan should
focus on choosing stocks with tighter risk b/c the upside has been
limited on average. Be more selective than average. Look to finance risk
at 1:1. Many stocks have been slowly chugging up only to give it all
back within a day when the market starts pulling in. As the stock moves
up, look to sell some into strength to finance the risk. If you happen
to get on one that is moving quickly and you want to give more slack
(AXSM, for example) consider selling a small portion but still looking
to finance a portion of risk asap. This is always tough b/c when it
happens this quickly, you’re forced to make a decision quickly. I find
that selling the smallest amount possible to finance nearly all of risk
makes the most sense. B/c in the moment, you don’t want to sell too much
of a stock that’s making a nice move, so simply look to sell as little
as possible. If the stock is slowly chugging up, however, consider
looking to sell half around 1:1 so you can cushion any 1-day drop which
happens so frequently.. It might not be the perfect plan. That’s
perfectly ok. Just have a plan, stick to it, and you can go back later
and critique through PTA. Even if you did have the perfect plan, you
wouldn’t know it until PTA confirms it anyway… Until you can go back and
confirm with PTA that you’re selling too soon, you shouldn’t be
concerned about capturing the ‘big move.’</p>
<p>Capturing the majority of the upside is one of my emotional
weaknesses. It’s almost more difficult for me to sell a winner and watch
it continue than it is take a loss. Taking a loss and it continues lower
= “glad I had a stop”, loss that comes back = “but managing risk is #1”.
Sell a winner and it moves lower = “I’m a genius. Beauty in the rearview
mirror.” Sell a winner and it moves higher = “I knew it. I missed out.”
Why is it so much easier to take a loss? That means I’m assigning more
emotional turmoil to making money than losing it. That’s stupid. I start
my unfortunate loser thought with a ‘but’. So, one way to think when
selling a winner and it continues higher is, “but I got a multiple of my
risk and successfully turned over my edge. What happens after I sell
means nothing. It’s a win becuase I made a multiple of my risk, not b/c
it went down after I sold. That’s the mental shift that needs to
happen.</p>
<p>I’m not very good at interpreting the feedback of my stocks. I find
that I will buy a couple of names, they’ll work, but not really enough
to allow me to cushion myself. Meanwhile, on balance things appear to be
working and I proceed to buy another name or two. Perhaps one will stop
me out but I think, “3 of 4 doing well, things are working on balance.”
Until, in a matter of 1-2 days, it all stops working. If I’m lucky, I’ll
get 1 or 2 names that work. At best, I have cushioned my losses, but on
average, I’m unable to cushion them all and I’m losing money on balance.
It’s tough to interpret b/c conditions are never the exact same as time
advances and my plan is now influenced by the feedback/information that
I’ve received between my initial purchases and my most recent
purchases.</p>
<p>Remember what MM said, “The most common reason for overtrading is
when people are buying good setups in a bad market.” The setups must be
working!</p>
<p>Mark stated today that, “Most traders lose money.” Most traders do
not beat the S&amp;P500.</p>

<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Fewer stocks on Focus list this week but still more than usual. Many
names either already moved up and extended or have started correcting
after moves up. Names like AVGO, ONTO, look like they may have put in
short to intermediate-term tops.</p>
<p>There are several group moves to note: homebuilders, semiconductors,
packaged tech., trucking, materials, auto stores. Seeing good action
coming from many names in these groups. That said, participation has
been lackluster and many of these names have been challenging to get on.
They also moved out first with little to no confirmation of things
working beforehand. Semiconductors look ready to pause for a little
while longer. Some names have little PB’s forming but weekly charts look
extended and things haven’t been working on balance. Additionally,
market internals confirming individual stock feedback with breadth
deteriorating and new high’s decreasing, etc. It’s time to be
cautious.</p>
<p>We need to see stocks hold up during this pullback as well as more
setups emerging. Right now we’re seeing a correction in the general
market and individual names are still selective. Several names on focus
list got clobbered last week: AVDL, APLS, VYGR, AI, ROIV, BLMN, HKIT
just to name a few. This highlights the risky environment but we also
need to stay engaged and diligent. Do things crumble underneath the
surface or will we see a normal pullback followed by more stocks
continuing as well as breaking out? I’m optimistic of the latter, but we
must wait and see. Certainly feels like a new bull is here.. but still
challenging and quite selective. Hoping things will begin working on
balance soon. Looking for a spot to buy into this pullback with ‘401k’
money.</p>
<p>Going into this week my focus is to simply follow the rules and go
into each day with a plan that I follow. If this is a new bull, there is
plenty of time. For now, things haven’t been working too well, but also
haven’t been terrible. I would likely be slight above b/e if it weren’t
for my MRVL and ASML trades. Both of which were a stretch at a time when
getting cute isn’t worth while.</p>
<p>Message of market: money is going mainly to big cap, defensive names.
Much less appetite for risk right now. IWM lagging way behind. Look for
support on IWM around 200-day during this correction. IF IWM breaks
down, look out! This would be surprising to me considering the buying
that came in a couple of weeks ago… IWO looks slightly better..</p>
<p>Watching weekend study session- up/down volume ratio went to neutral
today. This surprised me. Noticed IWM volume went red last week and SPY
at 1.1. Things definitely getting worse but most readings are still blue
besides the IWM and IWO ratios. Just something to note for analysis
purposes.</p>
<p>Last Friday was “Russell 2000 Rebalancing” day. This explains the
major volume in many names on that day.</p>

<p>Marks largest winners are between 30-50%. Usually takes profits
between 8-12%. If playing very short term, might take profits at 3, 5,
or 6%. Just depends on what the market is providing at any given
time.</p>
<p>Mark’s number 1 indicator is feedback from HIS stocks. Number 2 is
feedback from stocks on the Buy Ready list. These are stocks in our
universe- how are they acting? These two things account for ~90% of
Mark’s ‘feel’ for how the market is. The other 10% is how are the
indexes doing, up/down volume, new highs/lows, etc. The other 10% is
usually just confirming what he’s seeing in the individual stocks.</p>

<p>Reflection on week:</p>
<p>Several things to note: Looking at my paper trading account, I can
see a shift from purchases made in middle of May to beginning of
June.</p>
<p>Middle of May, I bought LVS, TJX, DUOL, MA, LTH, MRK.</p>
<p>Spoke with my dad today and believe I had a very important
epiphany:</p>
<p>When doing PTA, I oftentimes conduct mini-studies, as if I can find
some magic piece of information that would have warned me or given me a
heads up about the result of the trade. This seems logical but it’s a
terrible mindset b/c it opens the doors to infinitely many possibilities
and leads to over analyzing and trying to be perfect. Instead of
developing a new theory every week to back-test my results against, <b>
the only thing I need to ask is if I followed my rules of not. </b> When
I think in the frame of mind that “I must have missed something and need
to do PTA to find my mistakes.” This leads to a general feeling of
uncertainty. Simply because I’m asking the completely wrong question.
Eliminate feeling uncertain. Are you certain you followed your
rules?</p>
<p>Why is it true that this is the only necessary question?</p>
<p>Even during an easy dollar environment, the most you can expect your
batting average to be is ~60%. That means that even at it’s best, this
strategy is correct barely 50% of the time. Therefore, just because a
trade didn’t work, doesn’t mean it’s necessary or even possible to go
back and nitpick it to provide any clarity. It just simply doesn’t work
all the time. If you don’t follow your rules, you open yourself up to
the possibility that something (that occurs at high probability) IS
there and that something truly IS faulty and worthy of inspection.
Instead of opening that door of infinitely many possibilities, close it
by simply following your rules. When the rules are followed, rules that
have been time-tested for decades by proven champions in the market, it
becomes the judge and the jury. There’s nothing else to consider because
I TRUST MY STRATEGY. Did you follow the rules? Yes. Then listen to the
feedback and act accordingly. No. Then correct your mistake ASAP or
recognize the mistake and vouch to never make it again. If you don’t
follow rules, you don’t have a strategy. If you don’t have a strategy,
you’re doomed in the market. Sometimes rules get bent, and that’s an
area that will simply take time and experience to master. As a newbie,
the more rules the better.</p>
<p>This is indisputable proof that the ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IS
FOLLOWING YOUR RULES.</p>
<p>Another issue that I’m encountering as I’m at a new part of the
market continuum is FOMO. I experience FOMO because it feels like my
strategy is limiting me from buying stocks that are moving and look
great. Stocks like UBER, MNDY, SHOP, for example. I guess I want action
and I don’t want to miss out. I need to, at a subconscious level,
realize that thinking risk first and following my rules is more
important than filling my short-term desire to get excited about new
merchandise. I need to remind myself of these points as the week
progresses. I do a good job thinking this way Sunday, Monday.. Come
Thursday, I typically haven’t done a ton of work during the week except
for my daily scans, and I need to make habit to check in and remind
myself of these bigger picture ideas more frequently. Is this why Mark
say’s he wakes up every day and looks in the mirror to remind himself
that “he has the ability to do great harm to himself today.” It’s a
daily thing. Make it this way.</p>
<p><b>CREATE A LIST OF THINGS TO REMIND YOURSELF OF ON A DAILY BASIS.
Must read this list before each trading day. Absolute must. What do I
struggle with and need to be reminded of?</b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Close the door of uncertainty by FOLLOWING THE RULES.</li>
<li>NO FOMO. This is a business. What business would succeed if the
owner was giving into short-term desires/excitement instead of executing
according to plan? Would you work for him/her?</li>
<li>What has been happening to you in the market?</li>
<li>Buying stocks that don’t meet the criteria is proof of FOMO, desire
for excitement, and/or thinking reward first. Otherwise, what’s the
purpose of the strategy?</li>
<li>Be a professional.</li>

<p>ALWAYS REMEMBER WITH PB BUYS: Look for the good close the day before.
Didn’t get it on PCVX. Watch for this!</p>
<p>Forcing trades is very normal early on in your career, b/c you want
to be in there and to make money, and the number of forced trades will
decrease as you gain more experience but recognize that YOU WILL ALWAYS
BE FORCING TRADES to some degree. It’ll never be perfect. Because we’re
dealing with incomplete information. You’re not looking to get it
perfect, and you almost never will. That’s why we use progressive
exposure and have many tactics (cheats, low cheats, handle, etc.) to get
onboard.</p>
<p>Getting the base is just step 1. Next, and VERY IMPORTANTLY, you need
to see follow-through. I went back and noticed both VC and VTYX had
several days of buying after the breakout. How many stocks did I own
that brokeout but lacked multiple days of follow through? Did the
majority end up stopping me out? Very important thing to ascertain and
MARK emphasizes this frequently.. This time it registered.</p>
<p>The STEM model on Orange is sort of where Mark feels it lives the
vast majority of the time. He also trades like the orange model
describes, being very selective and some will work. He’s always thinking
in this way. Always cautious. Even when green, still cautious but being
aggressive with sizing.</p>
<p>Mark Ritchies take: 50% to 66% of time you’re on orange, or “riding
the break.” The other times ~25% or less, you’re in red, or in “park.”
Or either stomping on the accelerator, only 10-20% of the time.</p>
<p><b> Your goal as a trader is to get 1-2 opportunities per year to
make big money and simply manage the risk the rest of the time. Every
now and again, 4-5 years, you’ll have a standout year where you’ll make
100’s of % points. And then you have years where you’re up 30%, 50%, 70%
or so and some where you’ll be down slightly. You can make HUGE money
this way over time. The main goal is to not be down while things are not
working. Mitigating risk takes out HUGE problems that you’d encounter by
just trying to return to breakeven if you had large drawdowns. </b></p>

<p>I need to go in with a more robust plan. I rely too much on MPA and
make decisions mid-day. Developing a bad habit of dependency and I’m
realizing I’m not coming up with a solid, executable plan prior to the
market opening. BE MORE INDEPENDENT. It’s ok to check Focus list with
Mark’s but shouldn’t be taking ideas and executing mid-day without
having thought about them in advance. HAVE A PLAN. Consider turning
notifications off for MPA.</p>

<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>I think I have a problem with over trading.. I’m looking at my two
losers on the week and they were two of the sub optimal setups I chose
to buy. I also realize I have a tendency to make decisions on the spot,
mid-day. I look for the MPA focus list and let that influence my buy
candidates.. Not to a major degree, but I’m realizing I have this
tendency in my process and it’s not good. I should have a plan going in
and it’s ok to check that with the MPA plan, but it’s not ok to buy just
because one of the Mark’s pointed it out and I dont want to miss out. I
need to be more methodical in my approach and trust my approach. It’s
better to have a less-than-perfect vacuum packed process than try and do
everything perfectly on the fly.</p>
<p>Another issue I’m realizing in my process that seems to happen over
and over again.. I will buy stock setups and some work and some dont.
What about those setups that are working that I didn’t buy? I let these
‘other’ stocks work their way into my thinking / conviction about how
things are going. I have a tendency to ignore the couple that didn’t
work / ignore the effect on my portfolio.. meanwhile, I’ll have a couple
that are working that are keeping my portfolio near breakeven.. Then,
most don’t work and in hindsight I realize that I jumped in too soon. I
need to have a more vaccuum packed and preplanned process where I have a
select # of names I can put on. I put them on and ignore the rest. All
that matters is what’s in my portfolio and the feedback I get from them.
If they don’t work, go back and double check your criteria. If you made
good buys, and they aren’t working on balance, you know you need to be
cautious. I must have a predetermined amount of money that I’m willing
to risk and a plan - should I use a shotgun approach to reach that risk
or be more concentrated? These must be planned in advance and until you
have back stopped or booked profits, YOU CANNOT LET OTHER THINGS
INFLUENCE YOU.</p>

<p>My Focus list is full of names in Biotech, Software Technology,
Health Technology, Pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Added to TGTX today and bought ASML. ASML was bought in the
afternoon, around 1pm. Stopped on MBLY early morning on news of
secondary public offering of $42 per share. Seeing some traction in
names and all positions are green except ASML which is basically even.
ASML closed low in range yesterday.. would like to have seen it close
high the day before. Still great setup.</p>
<p>Today seemed to confirm that yesterday was just a needed pullback.
Everything opened low and continued lower early morning. I was down
slightly all morning on VERX and TGTX. It felt like it slowly clawed its
way back all day and by the close all my positions closed strong as well
as the general market. IWM and IWO got a pullback this morning and
recovered slowly all day as well. Closed just below yesterdays close and
strong action overall.</p>
<p>Several objective measures have improved: General market - both NAS
and IWM. % stocks above 200-day improving. It spiked up this week. VIX
at levels that it hasnt been since Feb. 2020 - just before COVID! It’s
hard not to feel like an easy dollar environment is just right around
the corner. Day by day. Patience and progressive exposure is key. If I
can backstop or log profits in the names I currently own, and if we see
more waves of setups and current breakouts holding, I will double my
position sizes.</p>

<p>Bought TGTX and VERX today. Both closed down very slightly from
purchase price. Was up nearly the whole day on TGTX and down nearly the
whole day on VERX.</p>
<p>Check out weekly chart of APLS. WOW! How does it play out from
here?</p>
<p>I wrote / thought that VERX was “riding both 20 and 50 DMA” and that
this was cause for concern. Check back on the result and if this
potentially did hint at a problem.</p>
<p>VERX was bought after the breakout squatted on a late morning
reversal. It remained above pivot but squatted ~6-7%. Should this have
forced me to stay out or was it wise to buy the squat reversal?</p>
<p>Tons of downside reversals today. Feels like many extended names got
a needed correction and then some… Feels like today could be the first
warning sign that the market is still the same as it has been.. Still
selective but definitely feels like its broadening.</p>
<p>Breadth CLEARLY moving out on the risk curve. IWM excellent action
with 3 huge pillars of volume during last 4 sessions. Just what we want
to see. And while the QQQs and SPY have already run up and are now
taking a little break. JUST WHAT WE WANT TO SEE. Now, see if my recent
buys can hold and my other names continue. Paper trading acct mostly
green and names looking great. Along with more stocks setting up and
follow through. If these names can hold up and we see another wave of
setups emerge, I will bring money in from LiveOak Bank and increase
portfolio size &amp; position size.</p>
<p>Paper trading account summary: green on 5, b/e on 3, down on 2.</p>
<p>Last two days there has been a positive divergence between the QQQ’s
and NASD % stocks above 200.. First time it hasnt either been a negative
divergence or in lock-step for quite sometime. Small positive
developments.</p>

<p>After running through weekend screens - participation definitely
looks to be broadening. Seeing leadership qualities in Semiconductors,
biotech, healthcare, and several technology-related sectors. Lots of
ideas on deck, where they caught support last week and are forming
cheats in handles or look like they could start forming cheats within
handles. Next week will be huge. How do these setups act? How do recent
breakouts act? Paper trading account has 6 names, in the green on 4 and
great looking breakouts in VRRM &amp; LECO. IMGN and AME very solid. GLD
doing its thing.. looks like it could breakdown.SWAV looks OK. <b>VRRM,
LECO, AME all had nice breakouts recently and have held up 1-2 days.
We’ve seen MANY stocks “pop and squat” for 1-3 days. Will these do the
same or will they point to a change in theme? </b></p>
<p>If setups and recent breakouts can hold up and/or improve into early
next week, some buys and small positions are warranted. Futhermore, IWM,
IWO had great days on Friday. Breadth made a nice jump. VIX put in
2-year low. And most importantly, some new leadership appears to have
made itself known (semi’s) and are holding up, and more names are
showing up. Still too early to jump in but could be right around the
corner if we continue to see supportive action. Am I too eager? That’s
what usually happens. How many more setups / waves of setups until we
have enough conviction? Observing and listening to Mark’s closely. That
said, Stock Feedback Model still on Red. Need to see stocks breakout for
more than 1-3 days. Still waiting to hear Mark’s take… <b>Mark
understands that things take longer than 1-week to develop in the
market. The reality is that 37% of stocks are above their 200-day MA yet
the NAS is running up. He is short-term bearish on the market because of
this trend. What has happened in the past when the general market pulls
back? I get stopped out! It’s time to be CAREFUL and be patient. Nothing
has changed yet and participation is still thin.</b></p>
<p>TGTX 30% decline after huge runup but looks like it’s turning up
here. Keep an eye on this- does it work?</p>
<p>Refresh on PowerPlay rules: Stock advances 100% or more in less than
8 weeks. Subsequently, the stock moves sideways in a relatively tight
range, correcting no more than 20-25% over a period of 3-6 weeks. 2
weeks minimum. Lastly, stock must develop a pivot that moves within a
trading range of 10% or less.</p>

<p>Terrible action again today. Wouldn’t be surprised if I got stopped
out of DUOL and LTH soon. Just letting them work. Financed most of risk
on DUOL and already sold 2/3 of LTH. Waiting for a pullback in the
market. Mark says, if we get a breather in the market, it would not
surprise him if stocks started acting well during or subsequent to a
pullback.</p>
<p>Not seeing setups. Volatility around breakouts still too high. Would
be down on pretty much everything in paper trading account.. Same

<p>Corrected my mistake from last week and sold 1 share of DUOL almost
immediately at open just above 1:1. Now I just need to ensure I
consitently apply these rules. Is the perfect tactic? Probably not, but
it will help me improve and I can critique it later. Also, if this is
indeed a transitional phase, let the market tell me first. It takes more
than one small win in NVDA to gain enough conviction. Have patience.

<p>Still maximum defensive posture. Should have sold 1 share of DUOL
into strength at 1:1. <b>Didn’t follow my rules.</b> Looking to correct
this mistake on Monday if 1:1 still available.</p>
<p>After taking some time this weekend to think and reflect about my
activity in the market last week, I feel like, once again, I got a
little too excited and eager to enter the market and put on exposure. I
let the market indexes pressure me once again. This time, breakouts from
6-week consolidations and all looks good, however, THE INDEXES DONT
MATTER. I must be more patient and less inclined to add exposure until
things truly are working, which takes more than 1-2 names to work to
determine. PATIENCE. PATIENCE. PATIENCE.</p>
<p>I have $75 of risk in the market. This is too much considering how
poorly the feedback has been for me. Selling 1 share of DUOL at 1:1
would bring the risk down to 63.</p>
<hr />
<p><u>Goals to set in Market:</u></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Not Losing Money</p></li>
<li><p>Consistent application of discipline</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about something Mark said in the Q&amp;A session on Friday..
One of your main goals in the market should be to apply your discipline
consistently. Even if your discipline is not perfect, it’s important
that you apply it consistently. Then, after doing that for some time,
you can go through and critique / improve your discipline to achieve
superperformance. This is super relevant b/c last week I was questioning
my decision to sell 1:1 to finance risk, thinking, “we’ll it only
reduces my risk by $12 and I already have a small position.” This,
however, is not congruent with my goal. I need to be less concerned with
having perfect rules than I am about doing something consistently. It’s
ok if financing risk 1:1 isn’t perfect, I already know it will improve
my numbers, but it’s ok if not perfect. Just do it and do it
consistently. Then, after a few months, look back and critique it. You
should do this over and over and eventually you will have ‘critiqued’
everything about your strategy.</p>

<p>Bought LTH and bought back TJX. LTH maybe slightly early but very
strong action and reaction to earnings, and some of these names have
‘just been going’ so I started a posn here. Did I buy right into the
volatility? TJX moving back through the pivot and I added back. Mistake?
More semi’s blasting off today.</p>
<p>DUOL RS blue dot today. DUOL hit 1:1 today, I only had 3 shares and
decided to hold on. I’m feeling guilty immediately post-market b/c I
didn’t follow the rules of financing risk ASAP, but my posn size is
already so low it would have booked me ~$6 and reduced risk to 6,
instead of 18. 12 dollar difference. It’s such a small dollar amount it
hardly feels worth making all these moves. General market broke out of 6
week tight consolidation. And NVDA just continued higher on volume after
I sold. For all these reasons, I decided to hold on and NOT finance risk
asap. Is this just another example of me feeling like “this time is
different” and I get spanked AND don’t sell at 1:1 to finance risk? We
will see. Either way, I accept the risk and feel it is very small.
Perhaps I shouldn’t have some blanket rule to sell everything 1:1 when
my posn size is already so small (that’s the predicament I face when
financing risk). Maybe it would be better to employ that rule when I’m
not doing well but only during a small correction where posn size may be
relatively light, but not micro like they are now. IDK we will see.</p>
<p>FISV looks amazing but it’s a regional bank stock and it’s been
riding the 20-day SMA. Hasn’t rode the 20 like this since the start of
the year. Is this a warning sign or am I reading into this ‘riding’ too
much?</p>

<p>Bought TJX, DUOL, and MA today. TJX mid-day retraced entire breakout
on earnings. Sold ~1/2 as it retraced entire move. Will it recover?
Notice on weekly chart: greater down volume on left side of base than
right. Was this a warning?</p>
<p>Sold remainder of NVDA into strength at 3R. Total trade just over 2R.
Very small win but much needed psychologically. Covered a couple of
small losses. With more exposure on, now we need to see.. will these
positions work too? If so, could be time to bring more $ into portfolio.

<p>PTA so valuable! Did PTA over the weekend and realized I should be
financing risk ASAP (even 1:1). Today, I sold 1/2 NVDA slightly above
1:1 and now I can hold remainder for bigger move. Felt wrong selling at
~3.5% gain but you have to adjust as Mark says. And as I’ve come to
understand, avg gain doesn’t mean shit when you’re losing $! Finance
risk is priority #1.</p>

<p><span style="color:#FFFF99"><em>5/12/2023</em></span></p>
<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Had a revelation today:</p>
<p><b> DON’T WORRY ABOUT THE % GAIN, FINANCE THE RISK ASAP </b></p>
<p>This idea that I want to sell at “a decent gain” is what keeps me
from financing my risk ASAP. In the moment, I always think: “I don’t
want to sell at 2, 3, 5% gain, that’s too low!” In a market like this,
forget about the % gain and finance risk when available. Free trade is
the most important thing right now, not average gain! Only after you
notice that financing your risk is costing you money should you switch
to holding for a larger (normal size) move.</p>
<p>In a bear market, financing risk should be #1 priority. Average gain
does not matter. NEW BEAR MARKET RULES: finance risk at 1:1 and free
roll remainder, or stay out. I will forever live by these rules. All it
takes is one wave of setups to continue higher (where financing risk
costs you money) to be able to hold for normal (bigger) moves. But until
you see that happening, you MUST finance risk at 1:1. Either way you
should be smaller posn., so what are your other options? Do nothing
different? Short? No, it only makes sense to adjust your expected
upside.</p>
<p>Going back to Special Session #1 in PTA (audio 1, ~7 mins): when it’s
not working, you’re being summoned to sit out or adjust. If you’re new,
don’t adjust too much. Minimal moving parts.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stopped on LVS today. Tons of early morning reversals. Much of the
same. Had considered selling 1/2 LVS with poor action all day yesterday
and <u>with close below 20-day MA</u> and I should have. This has worked
more often than not and should be a rule that is adhered to unless very
tight action and barely below MA.</p>
<p>Seeing quite a few stocks setting up or on the “On Deck” list. Could
be buyable here soon but market action and stock participation has been
poor. Can’t get any real traction going. Feeling like I should have
financed risk on NVDA sooner with even a 1:1 trade. Tough to take any
profits at 2.5% though.</p>
<p>I need to be taking winners sooner. The upside just isn’t there. My
avg gain is quite high, but this is why my batting average is scary low
(8.6%). How often does a +10% winner come along? Clearly very
infrequently. I need to be using this more as a gauge to help make
decisions.</p>
<p>Some reflection on my results: be very short-term or stay out; either
way be very small and conservative. After going through my ~30 trades, I
can conclusively say this is a ping-pong market with no real traction
happening from breakouts. If you don’t shorten your timeframe and sell
quickly to finance risk, you’re losing money. Stocks setup and either
move sideways for a while, fail shortly after, or provide you with
little gain that shortly evaporates. VERY few names have actually broken
out and worked. The problem I can see is that I’m not altering my
strategy to account for this shorter-timeframe. I don’t want to alter
too many things from the way Mark has taught me. I feel this is the
right call, but I need to be even smaller. It seems each time things
start moving, I find a reason to risk ~20 per trade, which after taking
2-3 positions, stings a little. This death by a thousand cuts still
leads to death..</p>
<p>Experiencing a good period and seeing/feeling what it’s supposed to
be like when it works is everything I need. In hindsight, I can
speculate as to why things didn’t work, but in real-time, each new wave
of setups is as appealing as the last. And even though I always tell
myself I’ll be super conservative (and I am), it still hurts to go
through this several times. I’m down like $600 and its been a slow,
light bleed for months. I’m ultimately down ~2% on my overall portfolio
and I think this is very acceptable. No one wants to lose money, but
without much experience, I’m just applying myself and sticking to the
tactics. It’s tough because stocks ~50% of the time will return to the
breakout and kind of dick around a little bit. When I’m in these trades,
I stay hopeful and think about how frequent it is for them to return to
the b/o and simply look for violations. Is there any way to know things
are going south without actual violations? I don’t think so. I don’t
think it possible to have a solid “feel” while looking at things so
myopically like that. I think it has more to do with, “What have stocks
been doing?” Have they been working, or not? Are you up on your account,
or not? I think these are the “Umbrella” type gauges I need to focus on.
No one trade will ever tell me enough. So when in a trade, don’t be so
myopic and hopeful. Have things been working? If not, look outside the
trade and act accordingly. Look outside/beyond the trade and adjust
accordingly. Just like you can’t “know” to exit a trade because it isn’t
doing X, Y, and Z in some particular order (can only respond to
violations); you can’t enter trades and get overly hopeful just because
it did X, Y, or Z. When market is bad, it can all turn around very
quickly. Be patient and assess, what is happening to me on average?</p>
<p><u>Even Mark still has to apply himself and simply act as the
caboose. He doesn’t know things aren’t working based on 1-2 days of
action so how can I? He doesn’t necessarily shorten timeframe and make
tons of adjustments. Apply yourself.. be micro or be out.. don’t make
too many adjustments.. when the results start speaking to you, listen..
adjust when necessary.</u></p>

<p>On NVDA and LVS. Both stocks came in today but doing nothing wrong.
Up on NVDA, down on LVS. Breadth of market deteriorating and negative
divergence occurring between QQQ and NCTH. Concerning that market is
being held up by few names. How long can this last? Feels like I could
be getting stopped out soon. Considered selling 1/2 of LVS today w/
close below 20-day.</p>
<p>Quite a few pullback buy setups: ONON, IR, PTGX, BMEA. Really like
the idea of playing PTGX and BMEA, serious HP under the hood, but likely
won’t b/c market condition. Maybe if I don’t get stopped or if they set
up perfectly. KNSL setting up nicely. Being patient and remaining
disciplined.</p>

<p><u>Comment from Mark M. yesterday:</u></p>
<p>The market looks like it’s about to make another move lower, however
Open Positions are holding up just fine. This looks like a little
shakeout on the right side of the general market (happened in 1990 and
2000) and is ultimately just building out the right side. SPY and QQQ’s
look perfectly fine and many stocks as open positions are up and holding
up. LOOK FOR MORE SETUPS and watch the open positions. This looks like
the start of a transition in the market.</p>

<p>Lot’s of decisions today. In hindsight, I was too impatient and eager
and wound up putting on more risk than I was comfortable with. I start
with micro positions but as things progress, they turn to small
positions. These small positions, when they all come in at once, end up
amounting to more risk than I’m comfortable with. I should have never
added to MBLY, AGYS, PODD, HUBS. I should have sat with my original
micro position. Mark never posted an ‘add’ buy on any of these stocks.
I’m too impatient and I want things to happen too fast. That said, I
learned something very important today about the MPA platform: Mark does
not “buy 90% of the stocks that are on the platform” like he said he
does. He stated today that while there are currently 17-18 open
positions on the platform that, himself and Mark Ritchie, are only in a
handful of them. Typically 4-5 names at once.</p>
<p><b>I 100% have been over interpreting the MPA platform. I let the
buys on the platform influence how I feel (or how ‘aggressive’ I should
be getting) but now that I know that Mark isn’t over here buying up all
these names, I need to tone it down and truly become vacuum packed.
Listed strictly to the feedback from the stocks. Ensure the criteria is
good and get the feedback. If they aren’t working, stop buying. Don’t
find ways to add to positions or think it’s time to step on the gas just
because the platform is putting on buys. MPA is simply highlighting good
setups for us (students) to identify. It all comes down to personal
portfolio feedback and personal risk tolerance. There will be plenty of
time. I will not miss a thing!</b></p>
<p>Institutions are still selling right into the pop to ATH on many
names. No apatite for risk. Retail traders buy these breakouts and
institutions take the easy $.</p>
<p>Looking back in my journal from previous weeks, SOOOO many names
broke down that had either just broken out or were setting up. Always
pay attention to recent breakouts. <b> When things are setting up and
I’m considering buying, continue to make lists of good setups /
breakouts and monitor them. Add them to the new watchlist in tradingview
called “Paper” as in a paper trading account. </b></p>
<p>MBLY earnings coming out on 4/27 in morning!</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>HUBS bearish engulfing and sold all throughout the day. Breakeven
result which I am happy with buy not so happy about how I got there: I
only had one share so I couldn’t sell partial at 1R (though it was
achieved) to finance risk. Under normal circumstances, I would still be
holding a partial position in this stock with derisked. Either way happy
with not losing money but tactics, tactics, tactics.</p></li>
<li><p>Sold all of RETA today to simply take a win and cover a few of
the many small losses I have taken. Very much needed psychologically.
Very few stocks are actually holding up and I didn’t want to give any
back. Small 5% gain but the market hasnt given me much more.</p></li>
<li><p>Sold half of AGYS today as the volatility somewhat picked back up
(although I added more shares right into the volatility last week). In
hindsight, I shouldn’t have made that add. FOMO decision.</p></li>
<li><p>Sold half of PODD today as the volatility in the pivot has been
widening. Doesn’t look right and it was my largest position with 33
risk. The right decision. Still holding half.</p></li>
<li><p>Sold 1/3 of MBLY today to take a small, psychological win. Only
~5.9% gain but I needed to take some off the table with the way my
portfolio has been acting. Results say 4.3% gain because average cost
but I looked at it as selling a portion of my original
purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>Sold the QQQ’s today as I was uncomfortable with the amount of
risk I was carrying. Nasdaq breadth has been deteriorating (all last
week was poor breadth) and I’m not prepared to stick around. The pivot
basically went drifted down from where I bought and the volume was
fairly heavy within the drifting area.</p></li>

<p>Feedback from stocks has been a mixed bag. Portfolio is about half
and half with stocks above and below my buy point. Stopped on ACLS and
EXTR while others have held up but not giving much gain greater than 5%
or so. Overall, an improvement from previous weeks but not enough to
warrant getting aggressive. Market is still highly selective and there’s
certainly no broad-based participation. Also, still highly rotational.
Need to close some gains before taking on more risk. <b> According to
Mark, market pullbacks will be very telling and this is where the rubber
meets the road. Pay attention to the volatility, participation, and
feedback from stocks. </b></p>
<p>Mark has 18 open positions on the platform, yet he owns virtually
none of them and is super conservative here. This is surprising and a
reminder that the MPA platform is not a model portfolio.</p>
<p>ASUR is a perfect example of why Mark say’s these run ups (non-power
play) with short bases are ok for trades but not for longer holds.
Oftentimes volatile after making such a large move up.</p>

<p>~7% move today in MBLY. RETA moving up and closed above 99. Bought
ACLS today and am down slightly - squatted. AGYS returned to b/o area on
lighter volume than b/o - looks fine. EXTR looks like it could stop me
out.. Base symmetry. HUBS looks like it’s setting up another buy point
but b/c minimal traction I won’t be adding. PODD flat and doing nothing
wrong.</p>
<p>% stocks above 200MA decreasing today along with A/D, more decliners
than advancers. Small caps doing the worst - is this surprising
considering what Weinstein said in his book about the beginning of a
bear market (money goes into more ‘trustworthy’ names)? New Highs vs New
Lows continuing to improve. Overall, seeing some positive developments
for sure but the market feels like a field full of land mines. Not an
environment to get aggressive just yet. Could be right around the
corner.</p>

<p>Good action today from individual names. Currently holding 6 stocks:
PODD, AGYS, MBLY, RETA, HUBS, EXTR as well as both the SPY and QQQ.
Total risk is 134 and I’ve already lost 113 in the month of April. $247
total ‘risk’ so far in April. That’s nearly 2% risk of total equity.
Disregarding the major indexes (SPY and QQQ), open individual stock risk
is 87 or 200 total for the month of April.</p>
<p>2 names that are VERY enticing: LSCC and ACLS. Top stocks in top
groups.</p>
<p>FFTY HUGE accumulation volume today.. Keep an eye on this for
Adri.</p>

<p><b> IGNORE THE INDEXES </b></p>
<p>SNPS an example of why <b> you must buy right in a bear market. </b>
Buying perfectly at 379 would have allowed for a 1:1 trade where I could
have financed my risk. I bought slightly late at 382. B/c of this, my
risk was slightly higher at ~4.5% and the gain I actually achieved over
the first 2-days was only ~2.5%. Had I bought perfectly, it would have
been ~3.5% both ways, enabling me to sell half to finance the risk.</p>
<p>Another thing I’m realizing is that I haven’t had plans for selling
partials into strength. I need to have set areas (with alerts?) where I
am prompted to sell a portion if the market allows. My energy and focus
has been finding new stocks to buy, with little regard for how to manage
my positions IF THEY WORK. <b> Have a plan for every possible outcome.
</b></p>
<p>Good breakouts to watch. Follow through? INGR, MTD, FIVE</p>
<p>I am learning why the “early turns” are less favorable to Mark and
O’neill. Many of the names that formed mini VCP’s from early turns
ultimately failed and needed more time.</p>

<p>Note: I chose not to buy MKTX on 4/4/2023 because the leaders of the
group: IBKR, SNEX, both broke hard 3-days in a row on elevated volume on
3/9/2023. This does indeed seem to have alluded to the trouble that MKTX
ultimately got into. <b> Watch the leaders </b></p>
<p>Compare the QQQ’s to the % of stocks above their 200-day &amp; 50-day
moving averages. We can see that while the QQQ’s have been rallying, far
less stocks have been participating recently. This divergence is a huge
red flag especially for the stocks that we traffic in. FFTY RS made a
new low.</p>
<p>When to start getting aggressive? When you can look back at your last
4-5 trades and they are doing well.</p>

<p><b>After taking a step back, a few hours after the market closed, I
realized that today I experienced FOMO because of the indexes. Recognize
it and correct it.</b> Who cares if the Nasdaq is moving up, the stocks
in my wheelhouse are not behaving well. Stay focused and don’t get
distracted by this man-made index.</p>
<p>I’ve done two experimental things over the last two days and curious
how this plays out. EXTR was showing serious RS yesterday so I decided
to risk $1 to keep an eye on it. Today, it’s lower that where I bought
it and it’s not showing RS. The lesson is 1-day doesn’t mean much - I
believe this is what Mark would tell me.</p>
<p>The second experimental decision I made was to buy HUBS on a pullback
to the breakout area today. This rarely works but as always, this time
seems different: it’s starting a new stage 2 uptrend according to Stan
Weinstein and has been among some of the better names during this rally.
I missed the breakout on 3/29 and it was on my radar. The pullback looks
fairly constructive so I decided to buy 1 share. It’s an older, big-cap
tech company (QQQ doing the best of all indexes), showing a VCP, new
stage 2 uptrend, and fundamentals are A+. I figured why not, but can’t
deny that I feel very guilty. It’s not a pullback buy according to
Minervini. The pattern looks so enticing and big tech has been
outperforming.</p>
<p>Other names that are starting stage 2 uptrends and are also very
enticing: MELI, WDAY, FOUR, NEWR.</p>
<p>I think to some degree I am feeling FOMO. There are many names that
are setup and still look buyable, if not now very soon, like: RVNC,
SGML, MNST, PODD, PMTS, GRBK, IRDM, LNTH, ASML, CROX, TMUS, GFS, HLIT,
HSTM. I’ve been stopped out of 4 of 6 positions, although it feels like
it should be 3 of 5 b/c ASUR shouldn’t have been bought. Is 2 for 5 is
just under half.. Should I strictly listen to this and stop buying with
many names still set up? Here’s what I think the answer is: yes, I
should be listening to the feedback from open positions and stop buying.
I have a feeling we’ll be seeing more volatility in names like HUBS,
MELI, FOUR, and that perhaps I just bought into the snapback rally to
the breakout. I will likely get stopped out of SNPS and RETA. There have
been enough names that have broken down to make me think they’ll get em
all eventually. If that doesn’t happen however, I believe this would
allude to the fact that you have to stay on the ball. Half might stop
you out (as Mark says) and you have to keep watching to see if more
stocks break down than hold up.. Only time will tell, but lessons will
be learned for a small fee.</p>
<p>Will I learn to never do this again or are these new stage 2 uptrends
really under accumulation as they appear?</p>

<p>Stock feedback Model leaning closer to red. Still holding SNPS and
RETA but down slightly on both. Bought 1 share of EXTR to keep an eye on
this stock that was showing serious RS today in a sea of red. Slightly
early but developing a low cheat. Many stocks were volatile today and
overall I’d say the action was concerning. My list of names that are
setup and ready to buy is expanding, which is feeling contradictory. I’m
basically down on 50% of names. ASUR wasn’t the best buy.. Mark says
this is normal to see some (half) of your stocks experiencing volatility
during a pullback in the market. This makes me think I should be very
selective and cautious but to still pay very close attention b/c buying
some breakouts could be worthwhile if the market can hold up. Tomorrow
the rubber will meet the road for many stocks.</p>
<p>That said, the SPY has been very orderly. QQQ distribution day but
overall fairly constructive. IWO low volume pullback so far. VIX still
below 20.</p>
<p><b>Stocks showing RS:</b> IRDM, LNTH, PODD, LEN, MHO, MNST, TMUS, TR,
GLD, EXTR, PMTS, RVNC, RMBS.</p>

<span style="color:#FFFF99"><em>4/4/2023</em></span>

<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>Tried ASUR today and got stopped mid-day. Stopped on WING &amp; ASO
too. <b> For this current rally, I’m only up on 2 of 6 stocks. </b>This
feedback, along with the volatility in many names today feels like a
shot across the brow. Have seen this too many times to not take
seriously. Glad I was conservative with 1% total equity risk. Two
thoughts on this rally / my stocks: was WING really that great of a
setup to warrant double the risk from my other positions? ASUR was a
short base in a continuation move with 99 RS. Maybe buying the day after
a perceived shakeout wasn’t the best idea. Looking back at FIVE, which
had a shakeout confirmed by Mark, you can see it shookout on 3/24/2023
and remained tight and constructive. He bought it days later on 3/31.
Either way, idt there’s anything wrong with a small starter position in
ASUR today (which is what I placed) but it’s a good reminder to let the
trade come to you and be patient. Only thing I would change is to take
half the position in WING that I took. This would have been ~$25 risk
which is what I took on my other positions.</p>
<p>IWM and FFTY wide down days. IWM looks terrible and makes me think
focusing on liquid big-caps is the best way to go. Many liquid names
look best as well as QQQ’s being one of the best indexes. I think it’s
very well still possible that most indexes have bottomed as there are
plenty of names that broke out and are holding up, but it may be that
were early and the market is still very selective. Time will tell. Need
to see potential leaders continue to hold up.</p>
<p>Names with volatile action today: BDC, DCI, FIX, RELL, MTSI, ESE,
FCFS, TFII, ESAB, AQUA, PMTS, EME, WIRE, TGLS, WING, ASO, CRUS, MHO,
COHU.</p>
<p>Noticing many liquid names that are in relatively new uptrends and
came from nice consolidations that have held up well: FOUR, MELI, HUBS,
CSCO.</p>
<p>Looking back in my journal from late Feb to mid March, many of the
names that were setting up and looking great are breaking down. I
spotted 5 big movers on 2/26 and all, with the exception of TMDX, made
big moves and subsequently broke down from ATH or 52-week highs. Same
thing happening over and over. Need another list of breakdowns to
confirm? Check the lists mentioned on 2/27 too. They set up and get sold
into at new highs.</p>

<p>Stock Feedback Model turned to orange today. Added 2 new positions:
WING, MBLY and added to an existing position: RETA. WING was a pullback
buy in the handle of a large base. MBLY isn’t fully developed and
position was small at 2%, a starter. Would like to see this develop and
tighten a bit more. Will be adding if that happens. RETA wasn’t a bad
add but it was slightly above the ideal spot. I learned a lesson on this
one as it was brought up in the QA session: I incorrectly added at the
high of the left-side of the base (52-week high) around 95. I should
have added around 93.50 (highest) as it was the high of the pivot (~2%
lower). Currently up on: SNPS, ASO, WING. Down slightly on MBLY, RETA
but neither stock is doing anything wrong. Looking to add exposure if
warranted, have ~$30 more risk until at 1% total equity.</p>
<p>Overall stock action has been encouraging and improving. ISEE and
APLS both gapped up huge today from excellent buy points. Stocks that
have recently broke out from good buy points are holding up: RMBS, FIVE,
BDC, CSCO, MSI, AXON, PANW, MHO, AXON, HROW, MNST, TRI, EXTR, ANET,
THMC. VIX below 19.</p>

<p>“The U.S. banking system is strong and resilient.” J. Powell eased
any concerns of a worsening banking crisis. He believes it is mostly
contained and due to (SVB) being among a riskier bank without enough
federal oversight. Market volatile all afternoon. IWM, SPY, QQQ, DJI,
all closed lower on huge bullish engulfings. Just terrible action.</p>
<p>Got stopped on ISEE. Tested the waters lightly and found out very
quickly what I need to know - STAY OUT. Individual names were volatile
today. Many bearish engulfings in individual names too. Very few names
even look appetizing and based on stock feedback they’re not worth
entertaining. Sit out power and cash reign.</p>

FOMC meeting tomorrow and anticipating volatility. COHU, GRBK, nice
setups that squatted today. STN full-on pivot failure today. Volatile

<p>Not many names setup. Few names in buyable position: RETA, COHU,
TSCO, and TH. Few names that could be setup soon: FTNT, GRBK, SGML, BJ,
HROW, MHO, MCHP, PMTS, MSI, MSCI. Some older names like HLIT, MAXN, SMCI

<p>Bought a micro-position in ISEE today as sort of a ‘mental health
buy’ as David Ryan would put it. Will do the same with COHU if it acts
right. SGML took off today from a decent pivot - went inside one day and
blasted off ~11%. Not many names out there and the best moves have been
in precious metals. Risking $6 on ISEE just to keep my eye on the ball
and see how this name behaves. Coming from a pretty good VCP setup.
Also, whether I get on it or not, if COHU can’t work, I shouldn’t
entertain the market. It’s in the same group as AEHR, ACLS, CVV. Best
names out there and it’s coming from a textbook VCP.</p>
<p>Low-volume on the general market today. QQQ’s look the best. SPY as
well as many stocks, have ‘bear flags’ or ‘bearish pennants’ on their
right sides. Will the SPY break to the downside? The daily range of the
VIX has been huge.</p>

<p>After doing some PTA (which will henceforth be logged <a
href="PTA.html">here</a>), noticing that many of my buys were spot-on
but they were near 52-week highs. My buys sometimes marked the top or
were at a breakout level that subsequently moved sideways in a volatile
manner. Markets simply aren’t bidding up most stocks into ATH or 52-week
high territory; and if they do it doesn’t last long. Few stocks have
stood out and look obvious in hindsight, but with no real trend and the
majority of setups not working, it’s been very tough to make money all
year. Made perfect buys on XLE, QSR, VC, VTYX, AXON, RXDX, IBB, BIIB,
PRDO, and OIH. That’s 10 of 16 buys that were excellent in hindsight.
I’ve come a long way in my selection and timing. Money and portfolio
management also making serious improvements. Down 2.31% on the year.
Right there with both Mark’s. Feeling no FOMO.</p>
<p>I did a great job managing my winning trades, despite only really
having two. Held them for an average of 26 days! As of this writing, my
numbers are: avg gain - 14.49%, avg loss - 3.54%, BA - 12.5%, W/L -
4.09, aW/L - 0.51. Results are telling me to be very selective and
conservative. A few problems during this last rally: (1) reaction time
to poor results in the market. (2) Over reacting to breath thrust
indicator (3) Slight FOMO near the end of the rally.</p>
<p>A few stops were hit early on in names like SLGN, QSR, and RXDX. At
that same time, I had 4 solid names with open profits: XLE, VC, VTYX,
AXON. I leaned on these open profits and took on more risk. Next time,
coming from 100% cash and a bear market, <b>I shouldn’t lean so heavily
on open profits coming from a correction unless the gains are locked in
with a backstop.</b> In XLE, VC, AXON, I had no more than 7% gains
(which I leaned on) and this later came back to bite me. XLE and AXON
both stopped me out. After getting stopped out on SLGN, QSR, RXDX, XLE,
and AXON with only VC and VTYX working, I should have held off on buying
and let the names I had play out. Instead I kept on buying without
making any real traction. On balance I was around break-even and I
noticed more names setting up. For this reason, it’s ok to continue
buying, but I should have had more alarm bells going off and should have
been SUPER selective and small. Buying should be very small and only the
best of the bread. I think I was blinded by a couple of names that had
double-digit profits, the breadth thrust, the general market, and
optimism from both Mark’s.. It ended up being that every name thereafter
stopped me out and I lost money on every trade. FOLD and XENE were
full-on FOMO trades.</p>
<p>Overall, I’m happy with my trading, but a few too many names due to a
slow reaction to stock feedback and slight FOMO took me down $200 or so
more than I believe I should have lost. My solution is the advent of the
daily journal entries and stock feedback model. I believe this will keep
me more in-tune and force me to take a more honest and thorough review
of my portfolio and the markets each day.</p>

<p>First Republic Bank announced they were struggling this morning. The
list now includes: SVB, Silvergate Capital, Signature Bank, Credit
Suisse, and First Republic. The explanation according to Mark, “The FED
has been aggressively tightening rates and this has caused many
depositors to wake up and realize that they can earn far more yield in
treasuries than leaving them deposited at their local bank, thus causing
a run on deposits. The FED has since created its BTFD program to help
stem any liquidity issues banks may be having, but the headlines
continue to be unsettling.”</p>
<p>Support has been coming in on the indexes but it’s from an oversold
condition (QQQ’s weren’t oversold and look best). Not much out there
that looks appetizing. We saw a decent setup and move in TSCO this
morning. ANET, CDNS, and TXRH all made nice moves (to new high’s) from
decent bases today. Expecting near-term volatility.</p>

an example. Contrarily, names like BJ and TSCO looking good and clearly

now. No real trends, lots of rotation. Sidelined and 100% cash.</p>

<p>CPI release this morning and the market opened on a gap. Volatility
is the word of the week for the stock market and I am practicing extreme
caution in these uncertain times. Here’s a note from Mark this morning
which provides more color:</p>
<p>Mark:</p>
<p>In panic fashion, the 2-year yield fell 100bps in just the last three
trading sessions, the fastest drop in over 35 years since the Black
Monday Crash of 1987. As a result - like Nomura - some have drastically
changed their economic and Fed forecasts.</p>
<p>While it’s premature to predict whether the recent banking crisis
will trump CPI and PPI data coming out this week and influence the Fed,
the expectation for a rate hike has indeed shifted slightly on the side
of a pause. One thing is pretty certain, economic data due out over the
next two days will likely fuel more volatility.</p>
<p>Follow <a
href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html">this
link</a>, which estimates the probabilities of Fed Funds Rate.</p>
<p>In an effort to contain the spread of contagion from the SVB
collapse, the Fed launched a new lending program late Sunday. The
creation of the Fed’s new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) is designed
to halt bank runs of stressed financial institutions. Eligible
depositories can now borrow for up to one year pledging Treasurys and
agency MBS, which will be valued at par. That plugs a $620 billion hole
created by the unrealized losses on securities holdings.</p>
<p>The structure is similar to those rolled out during the pandemic and
during the GFC. The Treasury will provide $25 billion in capital from
the Exchange Stabilization fund as a backup. As has been done
previously, any losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund will be covered by
a special assessment on banks, not taxpayers. Additionally, the
government will fully protect both insured and uninsured depositors of
SVB and of Signature Bank, which was closed on Sunday. Reminiscent of
the Bear Stearns rescue by J.P. Morgan in March 2008, this should help
limit the collateral damage to the economy and allow companies to meet
payroll and other obligations.</p>
<p>The big question is, does the collapse in the 1-year and 2-year
yields indicate the tightening cycle is over as I have long been
predicting is the “canary in the coal mine.” I doubt it. And if so, for
the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Have taken some time away from the markets. Sold the last of VC on
2/28 just before trip with the boys and it turned out to be a great time
to be away. The market saw major volatility during the past two weeks
and individual stocks have been breaking down. Many pivot failures and a
considerable amount of base failures. Looking back on my recent trades,
stop losses have saved me from a lot of turmoil. Everything is lower
than my sell points with the exception of: AXON, RXDX, and FRHC. <b>That
means 13 of 16 stocks broke down after setting up.</b> This tells the
whole story.</p>
<p>Some interesting and mostly negative developments include: Major
distribution in the major averages. IWM, SPY, QQQ, and FFTY all got hit
hard and the prospect of the indexes going lower doesn’t seem far
fetched. VIX spiked up again. SVB collapse and many banking stocks
getting hit hard. Is this the start of something more serious? XLF has
gotten clobbered; along with many other industries including XLE, XBI,
XLE, XLB, and XME. FFTY barely above its lows. Interestingly, the yields
have all taken big hits over the past 2-days. The 1-year got wrecked
today. Would love to see this break down long-term. TAN coiling on the
weekly. Will it break to the upside? <b>FSLR, MAXN, ARRY</b> all look
pretty good. Metals, steels, precious metals,</p>
<p>Sitting on the sidelines for the time being. Not interested in being
the first to this party. Feels like we have a ways to go with this bear
market. Staying engaged and ready.</p>
<p>Focus list: AEHR, FSLR, ARRY, PODD, EPAC, AAON, CECO, BOWL, ACLS,
HROW, ESP, TMUS, MSI, MNST, TH, TRI, AQUA, LMB, MCHP, ADI, STM, WING,
COCO. List added to index page today.</p>

<span style="color:#FFFF99"><em>2/27/2023</em></span>
<div class="box1">
<p><font color="black"></p>
<p>A lot of reversals today with a small list of names setting
up/breaking out. Also noticing a lot of bearish looking flags on the
right sides of bases. Notable reversals on focus list include: CECO,
TMUS, AXON, UPFT, GPC, VTYX, OCN, AGCO. Worth noting that both the SPY
and QQQ’s closed low in their range.</p>
<p>Interested to see what happens in these ‘bearish flags’ like: SANM,
HROW, KLAC, TMUS, FLEX, . Are they tightening and consolidating or
bracing to move lower? Feels like they’ll go lower considering how
poorly stocks have been acting. Lots of names breaking down/experiencing
volatility: BELFB, BDC, IT, ALNY, TH, RELL, GILD, BIIB, ARRY, APH, PODD,
IMCR. It’s hard to get excited in this market. Rotation is fierce and
breakouts to new highs simply aren’t working. The bids dry up. Sometimes
within minutes. Watching AEHR, MTZ, OCN, EPAC, ATRO, AGCO, and BOWL
closely for anything promising. Earnings coming up in quite a few
names.</p>

<p>Personal STEM model created and set to red today. This is influenced
by the recent change to red (on 2/23/2023) on the MPA platform but is,
and will continue to be, based on my personal ‘feel’ of the market. My
feel for the market is based primarily on feedback and amount of
pressure from recent trades. Thus far, 2023 has been very similar to
2022 in that breakouts are not working. Volatility is too high for
low-risk entries. Discipline and sit-out power will reign.</p>
<p>Big moves: FIX, TMDX, EME, ATKR, ALG</p>
<p><u>2023 Reflection:</u> My portfolio saw some volatility early on in
SLGN and QSR. These were the first warning signs that I didn’t take
seriously enough. At that time, my largest position was XLE which began
working immediately and looked promising. With 1 of 3 names working and
more names setting up, I decided to buy VC on 1/17 which went
down-to-sideways for a few days post-buy. That same day and on 1/18, I
got stopped on both QSR and SLGN. I let XLE and VC work and by 1/23 I
was up on both positions and green on balance; with that, I decided to
buy VTYX and AXON on 1/23. Both worked immediately.</p>
<p>I then added RXDX, IBB, and BIIB over the 26th and 27th. I got
stopped on RXDX same day and sold a portion of VTYX for 2R on the 27th.
Things were looking up for the most part. By 1/30 BIIB closed below
50-day and I sold half. IBB put me under pressure immediately but acted
normal. On balance things were good until the end of the first week in
February when I got stopped on ADEA, PRDO, and AXON. PRDO was the first
real shot across the bow. Beautiful breakout that came all the way
back.. all too familiar. Note: I tried buying more PRDO when it came in
early morning post-b/o and it hit me harder when it underwent a pivot
failure. This hasn’t worked and shouldn’t be done again. AXON was acting
perfectly (though subject to pullback) until it broke over 14% in one
day and stopped me out. This should have been a glaringly obvious sign
to stop buying and go into protective mode. However, I kept buying and
added FOLD and FRHC. A week later I added OIH, APH, and XENE. OIH was
the only acceptable buy of those final 5. Otherwise, FOLD, FRHC, APH,
and XENE were all <u>BAD BUYS</u> and can be attributed to FOMO. I need
to be quicker to adjust and interpret the feedback the market is giving
me.</p>
<p>In hindsight I can see how the ‘breadth thrust’ and new wave of
setups made me overly eager to get into the market. Both Mark’s were
buying and admit to being down slightly (1-2%) so far this year. I’m
right there with them, so I’m not too upset about the performance
because I remained conservative and adhered to stops. But this latest
run taught me that I’m not reflecting/synthesizing the market feedback
enough each day. Hence, the advent of my STEM model and journal.</p>
<p>Down about 2.5%, or ~$360, as of this writing.</p>
